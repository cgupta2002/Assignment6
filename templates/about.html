          <h2> My Story </h2>
          <p> Born and raised in suburban Illinois, I was always a nerdy and passionate child. I built my first PC at 15 and I've been coding since I can remember. I started with Scratch and have grown to learn many different languages and use cases throughout the years. 
            I'm a diehard White Sox fan, no matter how difficult things may be, and I frequently go to games when I can. I also enjoy playing Tennis and Pickleball with friends during my free time. I'm also a massive gamer, though the catalog has been less diverse recently due to less free time.

          <h2> Academic Career</h2>
          <br>
                <p>My undergraduate degrees were in Information Systems and Business Analytics from the Kelley School of Business, alongside a Certificate in Informatics from the Luddy School of Informatics, Engineering and Computing.
